# shopping-transaction-simulation
The aim of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of three simulators for potential use in sales prediction and business scenario creation.

I used The Complete Journey - Shopping Transaction Dataset, a large point of sale dataset where each transaction is considered a "basket" of purchased products.

This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each household's purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included.
